1:Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me; 
2:deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men. 
3:For behold, they lie in wait for my life; fierce men stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O LORD, 
4:for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake, come to meet me, and see! 
5:You, LORD God of hosts, are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah 
6:Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city. 
7:There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips- for "Who," they think, "will hear us?" 
8:But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision. 
9:O my Strength, I will watch for you, for you, O God, are my fortress. 
10:My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies. 
11:Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord, our shield! 
12:For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter, 
13:consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah 
14:Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city. 
15:They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill. 
16:But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress. 
17:O my Strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.
