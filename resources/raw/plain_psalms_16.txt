1:Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge. 
2:I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you." 
3:As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight. 
4:The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips. 
5:The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot. 
6:The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 
7:I bless the LORD who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me. 
8:I have set the LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken. 
9:Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure. 
10:For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption. 
11:You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
