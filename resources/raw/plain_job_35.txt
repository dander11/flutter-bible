1:And Elihu answered and said:
2:"Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,' 
3:that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?' 
4:I will answer you and your friends with you. 
5:Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you. 
6:If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 
7:If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand? 
8:Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man. 
9:"Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty. 
10:But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 
11:who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?' 
12:There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men. 
13:Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it. 
14:How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him! 
15:And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression, 
16:Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge."
