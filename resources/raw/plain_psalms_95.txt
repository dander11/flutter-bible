1:Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! 
2:Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! 
3:For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 
4:In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. 
5:The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. 
6:Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker! 
7:For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice, 
8:do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, 
9:when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. 
10:For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways." 
11:Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They shall not enter my rest."
