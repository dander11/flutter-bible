1:O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? 
2:He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; 
3:who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; 
4:in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; 
5:who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
