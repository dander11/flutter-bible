1:"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth"- let Israel now say- 
2:"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me. 
3:The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows." 
4:The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked. 
5:May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward! 
6:Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 
7:with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms, 
8:nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"
