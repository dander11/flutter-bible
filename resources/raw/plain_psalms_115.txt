1:Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness! 
2:Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" 
3:Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases. 
4:Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 
5:They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. 
6:They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. 
7:They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. 
8:Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them. 
9:O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
10:O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
11:You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 
12:The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 
13:he will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great. 
14:May the LORD give you increase, you and your children! 
15:May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth! 
16:The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man. 
17:The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence. 
18:But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
