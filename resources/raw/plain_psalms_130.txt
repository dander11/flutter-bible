1:Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD! 
2:O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy! 
3:If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 
4:But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared. 
5:I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope; 
6:my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 
7:O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption. 
8:And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
