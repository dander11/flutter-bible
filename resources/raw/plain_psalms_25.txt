1:To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul. 
2:O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me. 
3:Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous. 
4:Make me to know your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths. 
5:Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long. 
6:Remember your mercy, O LORD, and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old. 
7:Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O LORD! 
8:Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 
9:He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way. 
10:All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
11:For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great. 
12:Who is the man who fears the LORD? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose. 
13:His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land. 
14:The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant. 
15:My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for he will pluck my feet out of the net. 
16:Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. 
17:The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses. 
18:Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins. 
19:Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me. 
20:Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you. 
21:May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you. 
22:Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
