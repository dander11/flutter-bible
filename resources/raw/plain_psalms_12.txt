1:Save, O LORD, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man. 
2:Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak. 
3:May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts, 
4:those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?" 
5:"Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs." 
6:The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times. 
7:You, O LORD, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever. 
8:On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.
