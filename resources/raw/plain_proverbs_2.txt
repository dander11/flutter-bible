1:My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, 
2:making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; 
3:yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, 
4:if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, 
5:then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. 
6:For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; 
7:he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 
8:guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. 
9:Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; 
10:for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; 
11:discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, 
12:delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, 
13:who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, 
14:who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, 
15:men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. 
16:So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, 
17:who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; 
18:for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; 
19:none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. 
20:So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. 
21:For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, 
22:but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.
