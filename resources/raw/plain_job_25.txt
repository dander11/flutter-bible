1:Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2:"Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven. 
3:Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise? 
4:How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure? 
5:Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes; 
6:how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!"
