1:Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! 
2:I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. 
3:Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation. 
4:When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish. 
5:Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 
6:who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever; 
7:who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free; 
8:the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous. 
9:The LORD watches over the sojourners; he upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin. 
10:The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!
