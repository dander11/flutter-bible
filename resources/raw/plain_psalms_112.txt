1:Praise the LORD! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in his commandments! 
2:His offspring will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. 
3:Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. 
4:Light dawns in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious, merciful, and righteous. 
5:It is well with the man who deals generously and lends; who conducts his affairs with justice. 
6:For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever. 
7:He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD. 
8:His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his adversaries. 
9:He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor. 
10:The wicked man sees it and is angry; he gnashes his teeth and melts away; the desire of the wicked will perish!
