1:May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you! 
2:May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion! 
3:May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! Selah 
4:May he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans! 
5:May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the LORD fulfill all your petitions! 
6:Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand. 
7:Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God. 
8:They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright. 
9:O LORD, save the king! May he answer us when we call.
