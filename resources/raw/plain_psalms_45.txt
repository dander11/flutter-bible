1:My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe. 
2:You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. 
3:Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty!

7:you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; 
8:your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad; 
9:daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 
10:Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house, 
11:and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. 
12:The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people. 
13:All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold. 
14:In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her. 
15:With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king. 
16:In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth. 
17:I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.
