1:Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured, 
2:how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob, 
3:"I will not enter my house or get into my bed, 
4:I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, 
5:until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob." 
6:Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar. 
7:"Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!" 
8:Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. 
9:Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy. 
10:For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one. 
11:The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne. 
12:If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne." 
13:For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place: 
14:"This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 
15:I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
16:Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy. 
17:There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed. 
18:His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."
