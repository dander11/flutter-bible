1:Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me. 
2:I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate. 
3:His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me! 
4:I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases. 
5:Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor. 
6:Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD. 
7:Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised. 
8:We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for? 
9:If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. 
10:I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace. 
11:Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver. 
12:My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred. 
13:O you who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice; let me hear it. 
14:Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
