1:O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us. 
2:You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters. 
3:You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger. 
4:You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah 
5:That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us! 
6:God has spoken in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth. 
7:Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. 
8:Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph." 
9:Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
10:Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies. 
11:Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 
12:With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
