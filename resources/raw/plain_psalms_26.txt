1:Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. 
2:Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. 
3:For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness. 
4:I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites. 
5:I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked. 
6:I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O LORD, 
7:proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds. 
8:O LORD, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells. 
9:Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, 
10:in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes. 
11:But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me. 
12:My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.
