1:Why, O LORD, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? 
2:In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised. 
3:For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the LORD. 
4:In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, "There is no God." 
5:His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them. 
6:He says in his heart, "I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity." 
7:His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity. 
8:He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless; 
9:he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net. 
10:The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might. 
11:He says in his heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it." 
12:Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted. 
13:Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, "You will not call to account"? 
14:But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless. 
15:Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none. 
16:The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land. 
17:O LORD, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear 
18:to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.
