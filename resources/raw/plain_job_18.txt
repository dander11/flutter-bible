1:Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2:"How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak. 
3:Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight? 
4:You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? 
5:"Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine. 
6:The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. 
7:His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down. 
8:For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh. 
9:A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him. 
10:A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path. 
11:Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels. 
12:His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling. 
13:It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 
14:He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors. 
15:In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation. 
16:His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above. 
17:His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street. 
18:He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world. 
19:He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live. 
20:They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east. 
21:Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God."
