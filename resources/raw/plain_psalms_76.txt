1:In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel. 
2:His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. 
3:There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah 
4:Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains of prey. 
5:The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands. 
6:At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned. 
7:But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused? 
8:From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still, 
9:when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah 
10:Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt. 
11:Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared, 
12:who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
