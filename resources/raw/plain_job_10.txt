1:"I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
2:I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me. 
3:Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked? 
4:Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees? 
5:Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years, 
6:that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin, 
7:although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand? 
8:Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether. 
9:Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust? 
10:Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? 
11:You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 
12:You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit. 
13:Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose. 
14:If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity. 
15:If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction. 
16:And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me. 
17:You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me. 
18:"Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me 
19:and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave. 
20:Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer 
21:before I go-and I shall not return- to the land of darkness and deep shadow, 
22:the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness."
