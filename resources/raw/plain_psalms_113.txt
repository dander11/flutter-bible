1:Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD! 
2:Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore! 
3:From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised! 
4:The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens! 
5:Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high, 
6:who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? 
7:He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, 
8:to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people. 
9:He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children. Praise the LORD!
