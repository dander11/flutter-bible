1:Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2:"Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right? 
3:Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you? 
4:For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.' 
5:But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you, 
6:and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. 
7:"Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? 
8:It is higher than heaven-what can you do? Deeper than Sheol-what can you know? 
9:Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. 
10:If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back? 
11:For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it? 
12:But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man! 
13:"If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him. 
14:If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents. 
15:Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear. 
16:You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away. 
17:And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning. 
18:And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security. 
19:You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor. 
20:But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
