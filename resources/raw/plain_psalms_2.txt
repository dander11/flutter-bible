1:Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 
2:The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, 
3:"Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us." 
4:He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. 
5:Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 
6:"As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill." 
7:I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you. 
8:Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 
9:You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." 
10:Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. 
11:Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
12:Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
