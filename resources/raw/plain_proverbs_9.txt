1:Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. 
2:She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 
3:She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, 
4:"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says, 
5:"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. 
6:Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight." 
7:Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. 
8:Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. 
9:Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 
10:The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. 
11:For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. 
12:If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it. 
13:The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing. 
14:She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town, 
15:calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way, 
16:"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says, 
17:"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant." 
18:But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
