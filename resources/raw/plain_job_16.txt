1:Then Job answered and said:
2:"I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all. 
3:Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 
4:I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you. 
5:I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain. 
6:"If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me? 
7:Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company. 
8:And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face. 
9:He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me. 
10:Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me. 
11:God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked. 
12:I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target; 
13:his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground. 
14:He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior. 
15:I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust. 
16:My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness, 
17:although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 
18:"O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place. 
19:Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high. 
20:My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God, 
21:that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor. 
22:For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
