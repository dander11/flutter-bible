1:O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God! 
2:For behold, your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have raised their heads. 
3:They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against your treasured ones. 
4:They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!" 
5:For they conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant- 
6:the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 
7:Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
8:Asshur also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah 
9:Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, 
10:who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground. 
11:Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 
12:who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God." 
13:O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind. 
14:As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze, 
15:so may you pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane! 
16:Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O LORD. 
17:Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace, 
18:that they may know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
