1:Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD, give praise, O servants of the LORD, 
2:who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God! 
3:Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing to his name, for it is pleasant! 
4:For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession. 
5:For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
6:Whatever the LORD pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps. 
7:He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses. 
8:He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and of beast; 
9:who in your midst, O Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants; 
10:who struck down many nations and killed mighty kings, 
11:Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan, 
12:and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel. 
13:Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, throughout all ages. 
14:For the LORD will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants. 
15:The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 
16:They have mouths, but do not speak; they have eyes, but do not see; 
17:they have ears, but do not hear, nor is there any breath in their mouths. 
18:Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them! 
19:O house of Israel, bless the LORD! O house of Aaron, bless the LORD! 
20:O house of Levi, bless the LORD! You who fear the LORD, bless the LORD! 
21:Blessed be the LORD from Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise the LORD!
