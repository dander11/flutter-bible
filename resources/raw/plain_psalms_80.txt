1:Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. 
2:Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us! 
3:Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 
4:O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers? 
5:You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure. 
6:You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. 
7:Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 
8:You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. 
9:You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land. 
10:The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 
11:It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River. 
12:Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit? 
13:The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it. 
14:Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine, 
15:the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself. 
16:They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face! 
17:But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself! 
18:Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name! 
19:Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!
