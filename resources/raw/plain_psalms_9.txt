1:I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds. 
2:I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. 
3:When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before your presence. 
4:For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment. 
5:You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish; you have blotted out their name forever and ever. 
6:The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities you rooted out; the very memory of them has perished. 
7:But the LORD sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice, 
8:and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness. 
9:The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. 
10:And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you. 
11:Sing praises to the LORD, who sits enthroned in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds! 
12:For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted. 
13:Be gracious to me, O LORD! See my affliction from those who hate me, O you who lift me up from the gates of death, 
14:that I may recount all your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in your salvation. 
15:The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught. 
16:The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah 
17:The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God. 
18:For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever. 
19:Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before you! 
20:Put them in fear, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah
