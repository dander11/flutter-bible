1:When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 
2:Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 
3:The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back. 
4:The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 
5:What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 
6:O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs? 
7:Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 
8:who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
