1:In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. 
2:Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 
3:What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue? 
4:A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree! 
5:Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 
6:Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace. 
7:I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war!
