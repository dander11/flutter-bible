1:With my voice I cry out to the LORD; with my voice I plead for mercy to the LORD. 
2:I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him. 
3:When my spirit faints within me, you know my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me. 
4:Look to the right and see: there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for my soul. 
5:I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." 
6:Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me! 
7:Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name! The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.
