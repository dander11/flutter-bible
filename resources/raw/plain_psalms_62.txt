1:For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. 
2:He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken. 
3:How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 
4:They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah 
5:For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. 
6:He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken. 
7:On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. 
8:Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 
9:Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath. 
10:Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them. 
11:Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God, 
12:and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.
