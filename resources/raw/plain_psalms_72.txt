1:Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son! 
2:May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice! 
3:Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness! 
4:May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor! 
5:May they fear you while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations! 
6:May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth! 
7:In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more! 
8:May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth! 
9:May desert tribes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust! 
10:May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! 
11:May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! 
12:For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper. 
13:He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy. 
14:From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight. 
15:Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day! 
16:May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field! 
17:May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed! 
18:Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things. 
19:Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen! 
20:The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
