1:O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath! 
2:For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me. 
3:There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin. 
4:For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. 
5:My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness, 
6:I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning. 
7:For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
8:I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart. 
9:O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you. 
10:My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes-it also has gone from me. 
11:My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off. 
12:Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long. 
13:But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth. 
14:I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes. 
15:But for you, O LORD, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer. 
16:For I said, "Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!" 
17:For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me. 
18:I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin. 
19:But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully. 
20:Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good. 
21:Do not forsake me, O LORD! O my God, be not far from me! 
22:Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
