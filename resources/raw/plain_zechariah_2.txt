1:And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand!
2:Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length."
3:And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him
4:and said to him, "Run, say to that young man, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it.
5:And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"
6:Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the LORD. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the LORD.
7:Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
8:For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye:
9:"Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
10:Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD.
11:And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
12:And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem."
13:Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
