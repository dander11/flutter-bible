1:To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens! 
2:Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he has mercy upon us. 
3:Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt. 
4:Our soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.
