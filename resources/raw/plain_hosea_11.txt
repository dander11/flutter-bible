1:When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 
2:The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. 
3:Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. 
4:I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. 
5:They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me. 
6:The sword shall rage against their cities, consume the bars of their gates, and devour them because of their own counsels. 
7:My people are bent on turning away from me, and though they call out to the Most High, he shall not raise them up at all. 
8:How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. 
9:I will not execute my burning anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. 
10:They shall go after the LORD; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west; 
11:they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria, and I will return them to their homes, declares the LORD. 
12:Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
