1:The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
2:He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
3:He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 
4:Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
5:You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
6:Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
