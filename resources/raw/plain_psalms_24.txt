1:The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, 
2:for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. 
3:Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place? 
4:He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully. 
5:He will receive blessing from the LORD and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
6:Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah 
7:Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
8:Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle! 
9:Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. 
10:Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah
