1:I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? 
2:My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
3:He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber. 
4:Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 
5:The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand. 
6:The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. 
7:The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life. 
8:The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
