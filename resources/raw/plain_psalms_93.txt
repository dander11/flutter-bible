1:The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. 
2:Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. 
3:The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. 
4:Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty! 
5:Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
