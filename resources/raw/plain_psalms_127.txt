1:Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. 
2:It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep. 
3:Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward. 
4:Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. 
5:Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
