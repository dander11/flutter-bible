1:When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 
2:Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 
3:The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad. 
4:Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negeb! 
5:Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy! 
6:He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
