1:O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath. 
2:Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled. 
3:My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O LORD-how long? 
4:Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love. 
5:For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise? 
6:I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping. 
7:My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes. 
8:Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. 
9:The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD accepts my prayer. 
10:All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
