1:Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant, and a song of praise is fitting. 
2:The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. 
3:He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. 
4:He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names. 
5:Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure. 
6:The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground. 
7:Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make melody to our God on the lyre! 
8:He covers the heavens with clouds; he prepares rain for the earth; he makes grass grow on the hills. 
9:He gives to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens that cry. 
10:His delight is not in the strength of the horse, nor his pleasure in the legs of a man, 
11:but the LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love. 
12:Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion! 
13:For he strengthens the bars of your gates; he blesses your children within you. 
14:He makes peace in your borders; he fills you with the finest of the wheat. 
15:He sends out his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. 
16:He gives snow like wool; he scatters hoarfrost like ashes. 
17:He hurls down his crystals of ice like crumbs; who can stand before his cold? 
18:He sends out his word, and melts them; he makes his wind blow and the waters flow. 
19:He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and rules to Israel. 
20:He has not dealt thus with any other nation; they do not know his rules. Praise the LORD!
