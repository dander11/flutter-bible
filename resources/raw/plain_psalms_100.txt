1:Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! 
2:Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! 
3:Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
4:Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name! 
5:For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
