1:"Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up. 
2:After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, that we may live before him. 
3:Let us know; let us press on to know the LORD; his going out is sure as the dawn; he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth." 
4:What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away. 
5:Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light. 
6:For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. 
7:But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me. 
8:Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with blood. 
9:As robbers lie in wait for a man, so the priests band together; they murder on the way to Shechem; they commit villainy. 
10:In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's whoredom is there; Israel is defiled. 
11:For you also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore the fortunes of my people.
