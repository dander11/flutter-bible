1:How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts! 
2:My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God. 
3:Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God. 
4:Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise! Selah 
5:Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion. 
6:As they go through the Valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools. 
7:They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion. 
8:O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah 
9:Behold our shield, O God; look on the face of your anointed! 
10:For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11:For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly. 
12:O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!
