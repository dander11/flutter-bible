1:Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace! 
2:Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 
3:We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows. 
4:We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought. 
5:Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest. 
6:We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough. 
7:Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities. 
8:Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand. 
9:We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness. 
10:Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine. 
11:Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah. 
12:Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders. 
13:Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood. 
14:The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music. 
15:The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning. 
16:The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! 
17:For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim, 
18:for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it. 
19:But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations. 
20:Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days? 
21:Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old- 
22:unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us.
