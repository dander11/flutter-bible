1:Bel bows down; Nebo stoops; their idols are on beasts and livestock; these things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts. 
2:They stoop; they bow down together; they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity. 
3:"Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb; 
4:even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. 
5:"To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike? 
6:Those who lavish gold from the purse, and weigh out silver in the scales, hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship! 
7:They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries to it, it does not answer or save him from his trouble. 
8:"Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, 
9:remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, 
10:declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,' 
11:calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it. 
12:"Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness: 
13:I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory."
