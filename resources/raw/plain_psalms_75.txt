1:We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds. 
2:"At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity. 
3:When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah 
4:I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn; 
5:do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'" 
6:For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up, 
7:but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another. 
8:For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs. 
9:But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
10:All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
