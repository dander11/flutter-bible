1:In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain, 
2:for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart; 
3:if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 
4:The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man. 
5:The LORD tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence. 
6:Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 
7:For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
