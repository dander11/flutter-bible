1:And Job again took up his discourse, and said:
2:"As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter, 
3:as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils, 
4:my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit. 
5:Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 
6:I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days. 
7:"Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 
8:For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life? 
9:Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him? 
10:Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? 
11:I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal. 
12:Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 
13:"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty: 
14:If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread. 
15:Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep. 
16:Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay, 
17:he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. 
18:He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes. 
19:He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone. 
20:Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off. 
21:The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 
22:It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight. 
23:It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place.
