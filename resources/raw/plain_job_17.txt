1:"My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me. 
2:Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation. 
3:"Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there who will put up security for me? 
4:Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph. 
5:He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property- the eyes of his children will fail. 
6:"He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit. 
7:My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow. 
8:The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless. 
9:Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger. 
10:But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you. 
11:My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart. 
12:They make night into day: 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.' 
13:If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness, 
14:if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,' 
15:where then is my hope? Who will see my hope? 
16:Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"
