1:Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! 
2:It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! 
3:It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore.
