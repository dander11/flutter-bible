1:O LORD, I call upon you; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to you! 
2:Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice! 
3:Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips! 
4:Do not let my heart incline to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity, and let me not eat of their delicacies! 
5:Let a righteous man strike me-it is a kindness; let him rebuke me-it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds. 
6:When their judges are thrown over the cliff, then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant. 
7:As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so shall our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 
8:But my eyes are toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless! 
9:Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me and from the snares of evildoers! 
10:Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.
