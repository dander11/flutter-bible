1:The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good. 
2:The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God. 
3:They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one. 
4:Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD? 
5:There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous. 
6:You would shame the plans of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge. 
7:Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
