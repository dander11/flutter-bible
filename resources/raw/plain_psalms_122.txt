1:I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD!" 
2:Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem! 
3:Jerusalem-built as a city that is bound firmly together, 
4:to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
5:There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David. 
6:Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! "May they be secure who love you! 
7:Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!" 
8:For my brothers and companions' sake I will say, "Peace be within you!" 
9:For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.
