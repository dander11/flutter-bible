1:Shout for joy to God, all the earth; 
2:sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise! 
3:Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you. 
4:All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name." Selah 
5:Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man. 
6:He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him, 
7:who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations- let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 
8:Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard, 
9:who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip. 
10:For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried. 
11:You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs; 
12:you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance. 
13:I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you, 
14:that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble. 
15:I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah 
16:Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul. 
17:I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue. 
18:If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 
19:But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer. 
20:Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!
