1:O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults! 
2:You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah 
3:For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head. 
4:He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever. 
5:His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him. 
6:For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence. 
7:For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. 
8:Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you. 
9:You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them. 
10:You will destroy their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from among the children of man. 
11:Though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed. 
12:For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows. 
13:Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.
