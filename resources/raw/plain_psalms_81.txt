1:Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob! 
2:Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp. 
3:Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 
4:For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob. 
5:He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known: 
6:"I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket. 
7:In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah 
8:Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me! 
9:There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god. 
10:I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
11:"But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me. 
12:So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels. 
13:Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 
14:I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes. 
15:Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever. 
16:But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
