1:O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; 
2:many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah 
3:But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 
4:I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah 
5:I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the LORD sustained me. 
6:I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around. 
7:Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 
8:Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing be on your people! Selah
