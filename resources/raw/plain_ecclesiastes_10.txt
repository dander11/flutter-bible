1:Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 
2:A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left. 
3:Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool. 
4:If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest. 
5:There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:
6:folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.
7:I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
8:He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall. 
9:He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them. 
10:If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed. 
11:If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer. 
12:The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him. 
13:The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness. 
14:A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him? 
15:The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city. 
16:Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning! 
17:Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 
18:Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks. 
19:Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything. 
20:Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter.
