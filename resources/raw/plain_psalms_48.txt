1:Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, 
2:beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King. 
3:Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress. 
4:For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together. 
5:As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight. 
6:Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor. 
7:By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish. 
8:As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah 
9:We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple. 
10:As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness. 
11:Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments! 
12:Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers, 
13:consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation 
14:that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.
