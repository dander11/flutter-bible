1:If it had not been the LORD who was on our side- let Israel now say- 
2:if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, 
3:then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; 
4:then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 
5:then over us would have gone the raging waters. 
6:Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 
7:We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 
8:Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
