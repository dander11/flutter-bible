1:Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence- 
2:as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil- to make your name known to your adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at your presence! 
3:When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence. 
4:From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him. 
5:You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? 
6:We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 
7:There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities. 
8:But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand. 
9:Be not so terribly angry, O LORD, and remember not iniquity forever. Behold, please look, we are all your people. 
10:Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 
11:Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins. 
12:Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?
