1:Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; 
2:but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. 
3:He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. 
4:The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. 
5:Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; 
6:for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
