1:Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. 
2:Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. 
3:You return man to dust and say, "Return, O children of man!" 
4:For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night. 
5:You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning: 
6:in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers. 
7:For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed. 
8:You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 
9:For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh. 
10:The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away. 
11:Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you? 
12:So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. 
13:Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants! 
14:Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 
15:Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil. 
16:Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children. 
17:Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!
