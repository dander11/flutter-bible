1:There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
2:And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD."
3:And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you."
4:So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
5:And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest.
6:In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
7:Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
8:And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
9:And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place."
10:And Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living." And the Levite went in.
11:And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
12:And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
13:Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest."
