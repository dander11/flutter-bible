1:Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy. 
2:Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers, 
3:who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows, 
4:shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear. 
5:They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see them?" 
6:They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep! 
7:But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly. 
8:They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads. 
9:Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done. 
10:Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!
