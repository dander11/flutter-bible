5:Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody! 
6:With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD! 
7:Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it! 
8:Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together 
9:before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
