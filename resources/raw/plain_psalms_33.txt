1:Shout for joy in the LORD, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright. 
2:Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; make melody to him with the harp of ten strings! 
3:Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts. 
4:For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. 
5:He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD. 
6:By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
7:He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the deeps in storehouses. 
8:Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him! 
9:For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. 
10:The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples. 
11:The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations. 
12:Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage! 
13:The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man; 
14:from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, 
15:he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds. 
16:The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. 
17:The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue. 
18:Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love, 
19:that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine. 
20:Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. 
21:For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name. 
22:Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you.
