1:The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. 
2:Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. 
3:There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. 
4:Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, 
5:which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy. 
6:Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat. 
7:The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; 
8:the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; 
9:the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether. 
10:More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. 
11:Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. 
12:Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults. 
13:Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. 
14:Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
