1:Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world, 
2:both low and high, rich and poor together! 
3:My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. 
4:I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre. 
5:Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me, 
6:those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? 
7:Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, 
8:for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice, 
9:that he should live on forever and never see the pit. 
10:For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others. 
11:Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names. 
12:Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. 
13:This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah 
14:Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell. 
15:But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah 
16:Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases. 
17:For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him. 
18:For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed -and though you get praise when you do well for yourself- 
19:his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light. 
20:Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
