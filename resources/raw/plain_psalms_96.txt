1:Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth! 
2:Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. 
3:Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples! 
4:For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. 
5:For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. 
6:Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
7:Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength! 
8:Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts! 
9:Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth! 
10:Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity." 
11:Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it; 
12:let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy 
13:before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
