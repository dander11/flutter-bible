1:Then Job answered and said:
2:"Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning. 
3:Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat! 
4:I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 
5:I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me. 
6:Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me. 
7:There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 
8:"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him; 
9:on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him. 
10:But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold. 
11:My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside. 
12:I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food. 
13:But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does. 
14:For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind. 
15:Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him. 
16:God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me; 
17:yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.
