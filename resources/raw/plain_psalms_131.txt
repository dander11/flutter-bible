1:O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. 
2:But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me. 
3:O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
