1:Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways! 
2:You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you. 
3:Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. 
4:Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the LORD. 
5:The LORD bless you from Zion! May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life! 
6:May you see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel!
