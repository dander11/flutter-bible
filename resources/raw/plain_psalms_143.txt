1:Hear my prayer, O LORD; give ear to my pleas for mercy! In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness! 
2:Enter not into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you. 
3:For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead. 
4:Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled. 
5:I remember the days of old; I meditate on all that you have done; I ponder the work of your hands. 
6:I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah 
7:Answer me quickly, O LORD! My spirit fails! Hide not your face from me, lest I be like those who go down to the pit. 
8:Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust. Make me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul. 
9:Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD! I have fled to you for refuge! 
10:Teach me to do your will, for you are my God! Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground! 
11:For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life! In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble! 
12:And in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies, and you will destroy all the adversaries of my soul, for I am your servant.
