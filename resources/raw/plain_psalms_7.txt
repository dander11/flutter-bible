1:O LORD my God, in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me, 
2:lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver. 
3:O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 
4:if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause, 
5:let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah 
6:Arise, O LORD, in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment. 
7:Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high. 
8:The LORD judges the peoples; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me. 
9:Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous- you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God! 
10:My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 
11:God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day. 
12:If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow; 
13:he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts. 
14:Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. 
15:He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made. 
16:His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends. 
17:I will give to the LORD the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the LORD, the Most High.
