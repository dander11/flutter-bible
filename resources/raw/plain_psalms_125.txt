1:Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 
2:As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore. 
3:For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wrong. 
4:Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts! 
5:But those who turn aside to their crooked ways the LORD will lead away with evildoers! Peace be upon Israel!
