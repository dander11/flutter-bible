1:On my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not. 
2:I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but found him not. 
3:The watchmen found me as they went about in the city. "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?" 
4:Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who conceived me. 
5:I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases. 
6:What is that coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all the fragrant powders of a merchant? 
7:Behold, it is the litter of Solomon! Around it are sixty mighty men, some of the mighty men of Israel, 
8:all of them wearing swords and expert in war, each with his sword at his thigh, against terror by night. 
9:King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon. 
10:He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem. 
11:Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the gladness of his heart.
