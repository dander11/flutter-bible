1:Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the godly! 
2:Let Israel be glad in his Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King! 
3:Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and lyre! 
4:For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with salvation. 
5:Let the godly exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds. 
6:Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands, 
7:to execute vengeance on the nations and punishments on the peoples, 
8:to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron, 
9:to execute on them the judgment written! This is honor for all his godly ones. Praise the LORD!
