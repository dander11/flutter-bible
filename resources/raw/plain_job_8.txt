1:Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2:"How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind? 
3:Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right? 
4:If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression. 
5:If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy, 
6:if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation. 
7:And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great. 
8:"For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out. 
9:For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow. 
10:Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding? 
11:"Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water? 
12:While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant. 
13:Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish. 
14:His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web. 
15:He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure. 
16:He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden. 
17:His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones. 
18:If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.' 
19:Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring. 
20:"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers. 
21:He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. 
22:Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."
