1:He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. 
2:I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." 
3:For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. 
4:He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. 
5:You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 
6:nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday. 
7:A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 
8:You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked. 
9:Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place- the Most High, who is my refuge- 
10:no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent. 
11:For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. 
12:On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. 
13:You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. 
14:"Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name. 
15:When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. 
16:With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."
