1:God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
2:Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, 
3:though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah 
4:There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High. 
5:God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns. 
6:The nations rage, the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice, the earth melts. 
7:The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah 
8:Come, behold the works of the LORD, how he has brought desolations on the earth. 
9:He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots with fire. 
10:"Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!" 
11:The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
