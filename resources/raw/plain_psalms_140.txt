1:Deliver me, O LORD, from evil men; preserve me from violent men, 
2:who plan evil things in their heart and stir up wars continually. 
3:They make their tongue sharp as a serpent's, and under their lips is the venom of asps. Selah 
4:Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from violent men, who have planned to trip up my feet. 
5:The arrogant have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net; beside the way they have set snares for me. Selah 
6:I say to the LORD, You are my God; give ear to the voice of my pleas for mercy, O LORD! 
7:O LORD, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle. 
8:Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plot, or they will be exalted! Selah 
9:As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them! 
10:Let burning coals fall upon them! Let them be cast into fire, into miry pits, no more to rise! 
11:Let not the slanderer be established in the land; let evil hunt down the violent man speedily! 
12:I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will execute justice for the needy. 
13:Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall dwell in your presence.
