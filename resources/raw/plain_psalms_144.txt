1:Blessed be the LORD, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle; 
2:he is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me. 
3:O LORD, what is man that you regard him, or the son of man that you think of him? 
4:Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow. 
5:Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down! Touch the mountains so that they smoke! 
6:Flash forth the lightning and scatter them; send out your arrows and rout them! 
7:Stretch out your hand from on high; rescue me and deliver me from the many waters, from the hand of foreigners, 
8:whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 
9:I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you, 
10:who gives victory to kings, who rescues David his servant from the cruel sword. 
11:Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 
12:May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace; 
13:may our granaries be full, providing all kinds of produce; may our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields; 
14:may our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no mishap or failure in bearing; may there be no cry of distress in our streets! 
15:Blessed are the people to whom such blessings fall! Blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!
