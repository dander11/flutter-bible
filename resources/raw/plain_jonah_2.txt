1:Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
2:saying, "I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice. 
3:For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me. 
4:Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.' 
5:The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head 
6:at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. 
7:When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple. 
8:Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love. 
9:But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the LORD!" 
10:And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
