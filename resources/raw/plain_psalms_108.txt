1:My heart is steadfast, O God! I will sing and make melody with all my being! 
2:Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn! 
3:I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 
4:For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 
5:Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth! 
6:That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me! 
7:God has promised in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth. 
8:Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter. 
9:Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph." 
10:Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
11:Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies. 
12:Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 
13:With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
