1:"Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand? 
2:Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages, 
3:so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me. 
4:When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn. 
5:My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh. 
6:My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope. 
7:"Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good. 
8:The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone. 
9:As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up; 
10:he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore. 
11:"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
12:Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me? 
13:When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,' 
14:then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions, 
15:so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones. 
16:I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath. 
17:What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him, 
18:visit him every morning and test him every moment? 
19:How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit? 
20:If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you? 
21:Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be."
