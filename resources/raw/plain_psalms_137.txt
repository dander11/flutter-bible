1:By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion. 
2:On the willows there we hung up our lyres. 
3:For there our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" 
4:How shall we sing the LORD's song in a foreign land? 
5:If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! 
6:Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy! 
7:Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, "Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!" 
8:O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed, blessed shall he be who repays you with what you have done to us! 
9:Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!
