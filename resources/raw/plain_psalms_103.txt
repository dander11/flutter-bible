1:Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name! 
2:Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, 
3:who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, 
4:who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, 
5:who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
6:The LORD works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed. 
7:He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel. 
8:The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 
9:He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. 
10:He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. 
11:For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; 
12:as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. 
13:As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. 
14:For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust. 
15:As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; 
16:for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. 
17:But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, 
18:to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. 
19:The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. 
20:Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word! 
21:Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will! 
22:Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
