1:O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth! 
2:Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve! 
3:O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult? 
4:They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. 
5:They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage. 
6:They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless; 
7:and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive." 
8:Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise? 
9:He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? 
10:He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge- 
11:the LORD-knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath. 
12:Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law, 
13:to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. 
14:For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage; 
15:for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 
16:Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers? 
17:If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence. 
18:When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up. 
19:When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. 
20:Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute? 
21:They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 
22:But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge. 
23:He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out.
