1:The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
2:Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; 
3:your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you. 
4:Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. Others We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you. 
5:I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 
6:Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept! 
7:Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions? 
8:If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents. 
9:I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. 
10:Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 
11:We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver. 
12:While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance. 
13:My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts. 
14:My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi. 
15:Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves. 
16:Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green; 
17:the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.
