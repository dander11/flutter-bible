1:O LORD, God of my salvation; I cry out day and night before you. 
2:Let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry! 
3:For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol. 
4:I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am a man who has no strength, 
5:like one set loose among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand. 
6:You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep. 
7:Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah 
8:You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape; 
9:my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you. 
10:Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah 
11:Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon? 
12:Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
13:But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you. 
14:O LORD, why do you cast my soul away? Why do you hide your face from me? 
15:Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am helpless. 
16:Your wrath has swept over me; your dreadful assaults destroy me. 
17:They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in on me together. 
18:You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me; my companions have become darkness.
