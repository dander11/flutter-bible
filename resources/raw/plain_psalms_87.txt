1:On the holy mount stands the city he founded; 
2:the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. 
3:Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah 
4:Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush- "This one was born there," they say. 
5:And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her. 
6:The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah 
7:Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you."
