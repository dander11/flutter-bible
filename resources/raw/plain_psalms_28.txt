1:To you, O LORD, I call; my rock, be not deaf to me, lest, if you be silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit. 
2:Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy, when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your most holy sanctuary. 
3:Do not drag me off with the wicked, with the workers of evil, who speak peace with their neighbors while evil is in their hearts. 
4:Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their deeds; give to them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward. 
5:Because they do not regard the works of the LORD or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and build them up no more. 
6:Blessed be the LORD! For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy. 
7:The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him. 
8:The LORD is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed. 
9:Oh, save your people and bless your heritage! Be their shepherd and carry them forever.
