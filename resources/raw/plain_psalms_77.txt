1:I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. 
2:In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted. 
3:When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah 
4:You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
5:I consider the days of old, the years long ago. 
6:I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart." Then my spirit made a diligent search: 
7:"Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable? 
8:Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time? 
9:Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah 
10:Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High." 
11:I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old. 
12:I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds. 
13:Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God? 
14:You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples. 
15:You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
16:When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled. 
17:The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side. 
18:The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook. 
19:Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. 
20:You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
