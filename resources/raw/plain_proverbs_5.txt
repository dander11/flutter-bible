1:My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding, 
2:that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. 
3:For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, 
4:but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 
5:Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; 
6:she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. 
7:And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. 
8:Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, 
9:lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless, 
10:lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, 
11:and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, 
12:and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! 
13:I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. 
14:I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation." 
15:Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. 
16:Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? 
17:Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. 
18:Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, 
19:a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love. 
20:Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? 
21:For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. 
22:The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. 
23:He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.
