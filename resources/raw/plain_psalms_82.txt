1:God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment: 
2:"How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 
3:Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. 
4:Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked." 
5:They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
6:I said, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; 
7:nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince." 
8:Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!
