1:Incline your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. 
2:Preserve my life, for I am godly; save your servant, who trusts in you-you are my God. 
3:Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day. 
4:Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
5:For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you. 
6:Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace. 
7:In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me. 
8:There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours. 
9:All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name. 
10:For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. 
11:Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name. 
12:I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever. 
13:For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. 
14:O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, and they do not set you before them. 
15:But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. 
16:Turn to me and be gracious to me; give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maidservant. 
17:Show me a sign of your favor, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
