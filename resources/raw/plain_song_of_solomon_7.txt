1:How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand. 
2:Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies. 
3:Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 
4:Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus. 
5:Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses. 
6:How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights! 
7:Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. 
8:I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples, 
9:and your mouth like the best wine. She It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth. 
10:I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me. 
11:Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages; 
12:let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 
13:The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
