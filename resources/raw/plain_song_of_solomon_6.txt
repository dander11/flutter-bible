1:Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? 
2:My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies. 
3:I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies. 
4:You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. 
5:Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me- Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. 
6:Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young. 
7:Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. 
8:There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number. 
9:My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her. 
10:"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?" 
11:I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom. 
12:Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince. 
13:Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. He Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?
