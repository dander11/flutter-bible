1:O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might. 
2:O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
3:For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah 
4:Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life. 
5:He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them. 
6:With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good. 
7:For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
