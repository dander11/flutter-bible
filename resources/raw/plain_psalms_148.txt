1:Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights! 
2:Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts! 
3:Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars! 
4:Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens! 
5:Let them praise the name of the LORD! For he commanded and they were created. 
6:And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away. 
7:Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all deeps, 
8:fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling his word! 
9:Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars! 
10:Beasts and all livestock, creeping things and flying birds! 
11:Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth! 
12:Young men and maidens together, old men and children! 
13:Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. 
14:He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his saints, for the people of Israel who are near to him. Praise the LORD!
