1:Then Job answered and said:
2:"How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! 
3:How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 
4:With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you? 
5:The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants. 
6:Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 
7:He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. 
8:He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them. 
9:He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud. 
10:He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 
11:The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke. 
12:By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. 
13:By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 
14:Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
