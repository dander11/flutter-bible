1:Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. 
2:Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! 
3:For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. 
4:Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment. 
5:Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
6:Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. 
7:Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
8:Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice. 
9:Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. 
10:Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 
11:Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. 
12:Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit. 
13:Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you. 
14:Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 
15:O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. 
16:For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. 
17:The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 
18:Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem; 
19:then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
