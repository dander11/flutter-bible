1:The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
2:When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall. 
3:Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident. 
4:One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple. 
5:For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. 
6:And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the LORD. 
7:Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me! 
8:You have said, "Seek my face." My heart says to you, "Your face, LORD, do I seek." 
9:Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not, O God of my salvation! 
10:For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the LORD will take me in. 
11:Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. 
12:Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence. 
13:I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living! 
14:Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!
