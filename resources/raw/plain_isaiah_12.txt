1:You will say in that day: "I will give thanks to you, O LORD, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, that you might comfort me. 
2:"Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation." 
3:With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
4:And you will say in that day: "Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the peoples, proclaim that his name is exalted. 
5:"Sing praises to the LORD, for he has done gloriously; let this be made known in all the earth. 
6:Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel."
