1:I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. 
2:Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 
3:The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. 
4:Then I called on the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!" 
5:Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful. 
6:The LORD preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me. 
7:Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you. 
8:For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling; 
9:I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
10:I believed, even when I spoke, "I am greatly afflicted"; 
11:I said in my alarm, "All mankind are liars." 
12:What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits to me? 
13:I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD, 
14:I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. 
15:Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
16:O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. 
17:I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD. 
18:I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, 
19:in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
