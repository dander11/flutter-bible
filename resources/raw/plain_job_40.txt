1:And the LORD said to Job:
2:"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it." 
3:Then Job answered the LORD and said:
4:"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 
5:I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further." 
6:Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
7:"Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. 
8:Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right? 
9:Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? 
10:"Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor. 
11:Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him. 
12:Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand. 
13:Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below. 
14:Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you. 
15:"Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. 
16:Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. 
17:He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 
18:His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. 
19:"He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! 
20:For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. 
21:Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh. 
22:For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him. 
23:Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth. 
24:Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?
