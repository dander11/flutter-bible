1:LORD, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob. 
2:You forgave the iniquity of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah 
3:You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your hot anger. 
4:Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us! 
5:Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger to all generations? 
6:Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? 
7:Show us your steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation. 
8:Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly. 
9:Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. 
10:Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other. 
11:Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from the sky. 
12:Yes, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase. 
13:Righteousness will go before him and make his footsteps a way.
