1:Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people, from the deceitful and unjust man deliver me! 
2:For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you rejected me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 
3:Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling! 
4:Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God. 
5:Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.
