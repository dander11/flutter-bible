1:The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad! 
2:Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
3:Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around. 
4:His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles. 
5:The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. 
6:The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory. 
7:All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; worship him, all you gods! 
8:Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O LORD. 
9:For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods. 
10:O you who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked. 
11:Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 
12:Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!
