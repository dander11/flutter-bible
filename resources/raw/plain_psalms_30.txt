1:I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me. 
2:O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me. 
3:O LORD, you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit. 
4:Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name. 
5:For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning. 
6:As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved." 
7:By your favor, O LORD, you made my mountain stand strong; you hid your face; I was dismayed. 
8:To you, O LORD, I cry, and to the Lord I plead for mercy: 
9:"What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness? 
10:Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me! O LORD, be my helper!" 
11:You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, 
12:that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
