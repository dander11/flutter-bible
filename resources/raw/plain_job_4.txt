1:Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2:"If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking? 
3:Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. 
4:Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees. 
5:But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed. 
6:Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? 
7:"Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? 
8:As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. 
9:By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed. 
10:The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken. 
11:The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 
12:"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it. 
13:Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 
14:dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 
15:A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 
16:It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice: 
17:'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? 
18:Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error; 
19:how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. 
20:Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it. 
21:Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'
