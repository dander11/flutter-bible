1:It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; 
2:to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night, 
3:to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre. 
4:For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy. 
5:How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep! 
6:The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this: 
7:that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever; 
8:but you, O LORD, are on high forever. 
9:For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered. 
10:But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil. 
11:My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants. 
12:The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
13:They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God. 
14:They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green, 
15:to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
